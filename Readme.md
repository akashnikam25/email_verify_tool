 #### Domain 
 You definitely need the domain name.
 ### hasMX 
 It tells you if the domain can receive emails. Nice to have, but not critical if your tool doesn't focus on email functionality.
 ### hasSPF and SPF Record 
 These help verify if emails from the domain are genuine and not spoofed. Important for email security.
 ### hasDMARC and DMARC Record 
 Provide extra security by specifying how emails from the domain should be handled. Helpful for ensuring email authenticity and reducing spam.

So, while all the fields are helpful, the essential ones are the domain name and whether it has SPF records. The rest add extra layers of email security verification.
